- Support for ZUGFeRD 2.0 "public review" part 1.
- Now using factories to create/configure ZUGFeRDExporter.
- Export is now also possible on OutputStream.
- Removed need to call PDFattachZugferdFile(null) or exporter close();
- More unit tests, e.g. for custom xml export, PDF/A Schema extensions.
- The command line utility "toecount" is now integrated and the main class so "java -jar mustang-1.5.0.jar" should suffice.
- It now also features options to combine PDF with XML and upgrade XML files from ZF1 to ZF2.

First attempts be able to start with a PDF/A-3 in the first place and better error messages for non-PDF/A-conformance.

Further changes: 

* be able to specify profile #50
* close pdf files automatically after export #49 
* ZUGFeRDimporter does not close #48 
* command line option -e does not work on all-in-one jar #47 
* invoices have wrong namespaces #45
